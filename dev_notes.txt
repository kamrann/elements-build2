# Building SKIA

- git clone --depth=1 --branch chrome/m106 https://skia.googlesource.com/skia.git skia
  - Check what SKIA commit artist is using. Was the chrome/m106 branch.
- python tools/git-sync-deps
  - was some issue with python subprocess invocation, relating to use of python3, and PATH env var
- bin/gn gen out/static-msvc-debug --args='is_official_build=false win_vc="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC" extra_cflags_cc=["/MD"]'
  - add 'is_component_build=true' to enable shared library build, but seems to lead to issues with usage of non-exported symbols. possible this relates to is_official_build value.
  - can use 'bin/gn args out/static-msvc-debug --list' to print options
- ninja.exe -C out/static-msvc-debug

# fontconfig

- for now taken as prebuilt, from https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/fontconfig/releases
